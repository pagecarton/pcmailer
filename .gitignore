# This file contains default .gitignore rules. To use it, copy it to .gitignore,
# and it will cause files like your settings and user-uploaded files to be
# excluded from Git version control. This is a common strategy to avoid
# accidentally including private information in public repositories and patch
# files.
#
# Because .gitignore can be specific to your site, this file has a different
# name; updating PageCarton core will not override your custom .gitignore file.
